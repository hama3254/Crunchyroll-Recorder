  # This is only a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) for a semi automatic recording of the Cruchyroll content.
  ## My understanding of this [German case](https://www.aufrecht.de/?id=5231) is that there is no copy protection on the playback and recording is basicly the same as recording the Monitor/TV (via a Camera).
  ## Please check your nativ langauge Crunchyroll ToS (if acceptet because of the acccount registration) this may breach the contrat.
